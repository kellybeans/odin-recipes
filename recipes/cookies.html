            <li>Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.</li>
            <li>Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.</li>
            <li>Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.</li>
            <li>Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.</li>
            <li>Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.</li>
