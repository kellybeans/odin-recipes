            <li>Add the shallot and a large pinch of salt and gently fry over a low heat for 10 mins or until softened and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and chilli flakes and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir through the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then stir through the vodka and cook for 3 mins.</li>

            <li>Add roughly 50ml of the water to the tomato sauce, then tip in the pasta and cheese, tossing everything together over a low heat until well coated and glossy (loosen with a splash more of the cooking water if it is a little dry).</li>
            <li>Season to taste, then serve with a sprinkling of the extra parmesan, a good grinding of black pepper and the basil leaves scattered over the top.</li>
